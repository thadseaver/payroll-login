payroll-login
=============

Personal javascript project

Background
==========

At work, we have a company ID number that we need to use as part of the login at our payroll website. It's a crazy, randomly chosen string of numbers and upper/lower case letters. It's something that I'm not going to commit to memory and it would be a pain to have to type it in everday to punch in and out.

To help speed this along, I created a blank html page that has the ID number on it. I made that page my home page. To punch in/out, I launch Firefox, copy the ID number from the home page, click the bookmark to the payroll site and paste the number in. It works, but now I want to build on it.
Project

I'm going to use Javascript to get the date and time, then, based on the day of the week and time of day, I'll be greeted with a random message. There will be a button to "Copy to clipboard" the company ID number.

Challenges
==========

1. I'm not sure if there is a way in Javascript to highlight/select text on a page.
2. Copy to clipboard feature
